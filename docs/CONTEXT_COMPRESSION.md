# Context Compression

Box-Agent controls durable context growth at two boundaries:

1. Tool results are persisted before they can dominate a later model request.
2. Conversation history is summarized only when the next request approaches the model's effective input limit.

The two mechanisms are deliberately separate. Tool-result storage is lossless at the storage layer: the complete result remains on disk while the model keeps a bounded head-and-tail working preview plus the recovery path. Context summarization is lossy, so it runs later and preserves a bounded working set.

Native image inspection uses a third, request-only path. Canonical image blocks
are attached to exactly one main-model request without entering durable message
history. Their budget is estimated from decoded image dimensions rather than
Base64 character length, and the raw payload is redacted from session traces and
provider debug logs.

## Request lifecycle

```text
tool finishes
  -> immediate per-result check
  -> tool messages are appended
  -> before the next LLM request, enforce the fresh-result aggregate budget
  -> reserve any request-only image budget from the text-history limit
  -> estimate the next request size
  -> compact conversation history only when the threshold is reached
  -> attach the transient image overlay
  -> call the LLM
  -> release the overlay after a successful provider response
```

## Request-only native image input

`inspect_images(..., strategy="native")` is available only when the active main
model is known or expected to accept image input. The default `proxy` strategy
keeps the existing utility-model behavior and returns text.

The native strategy validates, orientation-normalizes, and downsamples the same
bounded PNG/JPEG inputs as the proxy path. It then returns provider-neutral
`input_image` blocks through an internal `ToolResult` field. The runtime accepts that
field only from an explicitly opted-in Tool, validates the active model
capability, and applies one aggregate request-only budget capped at 30% of the
safe input limit. Image cost is estimated conservatively from width and height,
with a 512-token floor and 4,096-token ceiling per image; Base64 transport size
is never treated as conversational text.

The overlay is appended only to the in-memory list passed to the next provider
call. It is excluded from ToolResult serialization, session persistence,
ordinary AgentLogger history, cache fingerprints, and summarization input.
Session traces retain only text plus image media type, dimensions, source byte
count, and digest. Provider debug logging redacts both Anthropic Base64 sources
and OpenAI-compatible data URLs even when full-payload logging is enabled. An
empty provider-stale retry retains the overlay; any response content or normal
finish releases it. If capability or budget validation fails, the Tool result
becomes a bounded error directing the model to use `strategy="proxy"` or fewer
images.

Provider usage for the response still includes the image input. The resulting
assistant message therefore persists only the numeric request-only estimate;
the next context calculation subtracts it before adding later durable messages.
This prevents an already released image from causing premature compaction and
keeps the correction available after session resume without retaining image
bytes.

## Oversized tool-result storage

`ToolResultStorage` in `box_agent/tools/result_storage.py` owns persistence,
preview rendering, and per-conversation deduplication. It is composed as a
shared runtime capability; CLI and ACP do not duplicate this policy. The root
`box_agent/tool_result_storage.py` module is a compatibility facade.

### Immediate per-result check

The minimum shared model-facing result limit is 20,000 characters and scales with the active model's safe input window as `max(20,000, context_token_limit * 0.25)`. Tools that do not declare `max_result_size_chars` use this contextual limit; a tool may still declare a lower explicit operational bound. Only ordinary results that have not already been processed enter this generic policy.

The following results are not processed a second time:

- a tool result whose `model_context` projection was actually selected is frozen by `tool_use_id`;
- `read_file`, `query_jsonl`, and `search_files` declare infinity and rely on line/character pagination, cursor/structured summarization, and result-count/character pagination respectively;
- `bash` and `bash_output` also declare infinity because they already apply one 50,000-character 40% head + 60% tail truncation inside the tool.

Read-like tools are not externalized by the single-result check because persisting every normal page only to make the model read it again would create a loop. Infinity opts out of that immediate check, but a large parallel batch can still externalize its largest pages to satisfy the aggregate request budget. A tool can also request persistence of complete recoverable text through `ToolResult.persistence_content`.

When an eligible result exceeds the limit:

- a string is saved as `.txt`;
- an array containing only text blocks is serialized as formatted JSON and saved as `.json`;
- files live under `~/.box-agent/sessions/<session>/tool-results/<tool_use_id>.<ext>`;
- exclusive-create (`x`, equivalent to `wx`) prevents overwriting an existing result;
- a stable `<persisted-output>` head-and-tail preview replaces the model-facing content.

The original result is preserved when it is below the limit, contains an image or any other non-text block, or cannot be persisted. Empty output is normalized to `(<Tool name> completed with no output)`; for Bash this is `(Bash completed with no output)`.

Each `tool_use_id` receives one decision. A persisted replacement is cached and reused in later loop iterations, so the result is not written repeatedly. Results already present when a session is resumed are frozen and are not retroactively externalized.

Tools may still bound their own output for operational reasons. When they do, they pass the complete persistable text through `ToolResult.persistence_content`; only `ToolResultStorage` writes it. Bash uses this path for both successful and failed commands: the complete output is saved, while the model keeps the tool-generated head/tail plus the saved path instead of receiving a second generic 2,000-character head preview. Semantic `model_context` projections remain a separate tool concern; once selected, neither the immediate check nor the fresh aggregate budget processes them again.

### Preview format

The preview algorithm:

1. Keeps at most 2,000 characters in total.
2. Preserves both the beginning and the end with an explicit omitted-middle marker.
3. Prefers nearby newline boundaries when that avoids partial lines.
4. Preserves the exact head and tail even for a single long line.

For an ordinary unprocessed result, the model-facing form is:

```text
<persisted-output>
Output too large (...). Full output saved to: ...

Preview (head + tail, up to 2.0KB):
...
</persisted-output>
```

For a self-bounded tool that supplies `persistence_content`, the body is labeled `Tool-bounded output` and contains the tool's existing bounded result instead of another generic preview.

### Aggregate fresh-result budget

Before every LLM request, results first seen during the current conversation are checked against a contextual aggregate budget of `max(50,000, context_token_limit * 0.50)` characters. The pass:

1. Considers only fresh `tool_use_id` values.
2. Excludes selected `model_context` projections, but still counts self-bounded tools whose per-result declaration is infinity. Infinity disables immediate per-result persistence; it does not exempt a parallel batch from the aggregate budget.
3. Sorts eligible results from largest to smallest.
4. Keeps a head-and-tail preview plus the recovery path, shrinking each preview according to the batch budget, and counts the wrapper's actual model-facing length.
5. Persists and replaces the largest results until the actual remaining fresh content is at or below the budget.

Unsupported blocks and persistence failures remain unchanged. Since IDs are marked seen during the pass, later requests do not reconsider the same results. This handles a batch of parallel tool calls whose individual results are below the per-result limit but are too large together.

## Context-limit compaction

### Threshold

The trigger is derived from the model's input budget:

```text
autoCompactThreshold = 0.9 * (context_window - max_output_tokens)
```

`LLMConfig.context_token_limit` reserves the configured maximum output budget,
then keeps 10% of the remaining input budget as headroom for estimation drift
and the summary request.

ACP model bindings may override both values with the selected model's
`contextWindow` and `maxTokens`. Context/runtime composition derives the input limit when the
session is created and recomputes it whenever the binding changes between
turns. Missing binding capabilities fall back to `config.yaml`, which remains
the capability source for user-configured model presets.

### Estimating the next request

Provider clients attach usage metadata to the assistant message produced by a real API response. Compaction finds the newest such message and computes its complete response context as:

```text
input_tokens
+ cache_creation_input_tokens
+ cache_read_input_tokens
+ output_tokens
```

It then estimates messages appended after that response conservatively. If no message has real API usage, the entire pending request—including tool schemas—is estimated with the larger of `characters / 4` and UTF-8 bytes `/ 3`. This avoids severe under-counting for CJK and other multibyte text.

### Compacted message layout

When a recoverable workflow provides a current filesystem-derived checkpoint that fits the bounded checkpoint budget, compaction rebuilds directly from that checkpoint, the exact latest user message, the protocol-complete bounded recent group, and runtime state. This `checkpoint` mode performs no summary-model call. Other turns make one summary request by appending a temporary `user` instruction to the exact existing message list. It does not serialize messages into a new prompt and does not split or roll the source. This preserves the complete provider message prefix so the summary request can reuse its KV cache. ACP resolves this call through the session model router and caps it at 4,096 output tokens. Automatic sessions may select only from the host-provided `autoRouting.models` pool, ranked by the summary task tags, ability, and context fit. Context fit uses the active Agent's safe input limit so a small-window utility model is not selected for a larger history. Explicitly selected sessions stay on that exact model; there is no independent lite-model switch. Other hosts may supply a dedicated summary client or fall back to the main client. Tools and thinking are disabled. The instruction requires a chronological list of every user message and places all structured analysis inside one `<summary>...</summary>` block, with an embedded nine-section output example. The response must consist of exactly one non-empty summary block; only its inner text is written after `Summary:` and the tags are discarded. The requested and locally enforced summary limit is 8,000 characters; if the rebuilt request still exceeds the safe input limit, the same summary is deterministically tightened to 4,000 and finally 2,000 characters without another provider call. If the call fails, is malformed, or returns empty output, an explicitly lossy deterministic bounded fallback is used.

The model output is wrapped in this synthetic `user` message:

```text
This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Summary:
<model-generated summary>

Continue the conversation from where it left off without asking the user any further questions. Resume directly — do not acknowledge the summary, do not recap what was happening, do not preface with "I'll continue" or similar. Pick up the last task as if the break never happened.
```

The rebuilt history is ordered as follows:

```text
system message
summary user message
bounded recent messages
runtime-state user message
```

Recent selection applies to user, assistant, and tool messages. Assistant tool calls stay grouped with their contiguous tool results. Selection targets at most 5 messages and 20,000 total characters, and the latest real user message is always retained verbatim. When the newest complete protocol group alone exceeds the character cap, compaction keeps the exact assistant tool calls, arguments, result IDs, ordering, and result count while replacing already-summarized assistant reasoning and tool-result bodies with bounded receipts. A request is blocked only when the remaining exact user text, tool-call arguments, system instructions, tool schemas, bounded summary, and runtime state still cannot fit.

Compaction does not discover, reread, or replay recent files.

Current goal, todo, and plan state are read through their explicit, side-effect-free `compaction_state` contract; compaction never invokes a normal tool call. Their combined runtime-state message is capped at 12,000 characters. Full active skill instructions remain pinned in the system message and are not reconstructed by replaying historical `get_skill` calls. Internal summary/runtime-state messages are excluded whenever control policy asks for the latest real user text.

If the rebuilt request still exceeds the safe limit, the outcome is marked blocked instead of silently sending a known-oversized request.

## Adjacent protections

Write/edit tool-call arguments remain verbatim until whole-history compaction summarizes their turn; they are not independently replaced with history placeholders. This is separate from tool-result storage. A legacy safety guard still prevents placeholders from older or externally supplied sessions from being reused as executable file or code arguments.
