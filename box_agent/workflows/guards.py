"""Pure loop guards and continuation decisions for workflow policies.

These are the stateless building blocks behind opt-in circuit breakers that
keep a run from flailing or stopping prematurely:

- tool-call budget messages (cap repeated web_search etc.),
- the completion gate (force continuation until verifiable evidence
  exists — borrowed in spirit from oh-my-codex's Stop gate, but
  evidence-based rather than prose-pattern-based),
- the near-limit and no-progress wrap-up nudges.

Everything here is side-effect-free apart from read-only artifact checks.
Workflow plugins own policy; ``AgentLoopKernel`` owns only generic control
flow and consumes their typed decisions.
