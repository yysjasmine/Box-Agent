# PPTX Outline Planning

Every new controlled deck writes this planning artifact before scaffolding.
Do not turn a complete user-supplied page list into a new invented storyline:
map it directly into `outline.json` and keep that pass lightweight. Broad or
partial prompts require the fuller narrative/evidence planning described below.

The goal is to make the storyline, per-slide message, visual intent, and
evidence explicit before visual layout starts without overriding user intent.

## Decision Gate

Create `outline.json` for every new controlled deck request. When the user's
prompt already contains a page-by-page breakdown with titles, content, and
order, preserve it as a direct traceability mapping rather than expanding or
reordering it.

When the host includes a `<presentation_config>` block, use each field's
`source` to determine its strength. An `explicit` value from the user's
original request or an actively changed card choice is a hard constraint;
`recommended` and `default` values are soft framing and do not override the
source material or original prompt. `confirmed_by=user` alone does not upgrade
unchanged soft defaults. Use its audience to shape the outline, adapt
tone/storyline to its role and scene, and activate `creative_image_mode` only
when its mode is `creative`. Do not ask for a choice already present in that
block.

For page count, first identify the independent narrative beats and the amount
of content each beat can carry clearly, then create one slide per beat (or map
the user's supplied page structure directly). `page_count_auto`, or a range
whose source is `recommended` or `default`, is only a soft planning hint. Do
not aim for the midpoint of `5-10`, treat eight slides as a default, pad thin
material, or merge distinct conclusions just to hit a suggested range. Only a
concrete page count or range explicitly stated by the user, including an
actively selected range in the card, is a hard constraint.

Typical cases that benefit from an outline:

- The user gives only a broad topic, goal, or document type.
- The user provides partial structure (some titles, some content) that needs
  gap-filling, reordering, or evidence-to-slide mapping.
- The deck is narrative-heavy (BP, strategy, consulting, research,
  investment, product launch, annual review, data-story, etc.).
- Page count, slide order, audience, evidence, or key claims are unclear.
- The prompt asks for "帮我规划", "大纲", "结构", "storyline", or equivalent.

Do not create a second outline, and do not use `plan_write` as a substitute for
this artifact.

## When the request is under-specified or under-sourced

A new deck must not start from too little. But "too little" is never answered
with a cold refusal — it is answered by **asking back** or **routing to
research**. Pick the branch that fits:

1. **Content is sufficient.** The user or an upstream expert/research step
   already gave usable page-level material (titles, order, key points, data).
   Treat it as the source of truth and build the outline. Do not invent a
   competing storyline over usable input.

2. **The request is a solution/design brief.** A prompt that names the goal,
   requested system or product components, integrations/processes to cover, and
   approximate page count is sufficient for a proposed architecture or
   implementation plan. Use `source_mode=user_provided`, frame unsupplied
   details as recommendations, and do not load `research-synthesis` or browse by
   default. If a named external product/API claim genuinely needs confirmation,
   use at most two targeted official-source lookups; switch to the research
   branch only if the requested deck becomes evidence-driven.

3. **Only the structure/framing is unclear** (facts are available, but audience,
   page count, ordering, emphasis, or plan-vs-build is ambiguous). **Ask back** —
   one focused question with only the minimum fields, and where reasonable offer a sensible default
   the user can simply confirm. Examples:
   - "这套面向投资人还是内部评审?大概几页?" (then propose a default count)
   - "你已有这些要点,我按 问题→方案→市场→进展 的顺序排,可以吗?"
   Do not stall with an open-ended "tell me more", and do not silently guess an
   entire narrative the user never asked for.

4. **The topic needs facts you don't have** (claims, market/industry/company/
   policy data, anything that must be sourced) and the material is thin or
   absent. **Do not fabricate, and do not write a flat rejection.** Load the
   research workflow first, then build the outline from the sourced findings:

   ```
   get_skill(skill_name="research-synthesis")
   ```

   Follow the selected `research-synthesis` route's coarse-to-fine evidence
   budget and persist its research artifacts. Do not replace that workflow with
   a PPT-specific four-query scan: a one-line request for a sourced factual
   report still needs enough landscape, authority, and conflict coverage to
   support the slide plan, while a concise proposal brief stays in branch 2. After
   the route is complete, run its bundled artifact validator with
   `--report research/qa/{topic}_research_check.json`; even a reduced sequential
   run should preserve distinct dimensions, but the dimension target is a
   quality goal rather than a delivery gate. The workflow converts a fresh
   report into the generic `presentation_handoff` contract: `full` uses the
   complete verified facts, `partial` uses only its verified subset, and `framework` creates
   explicit unavailable-data placeholders. Cover, agenda, and section-divider
   pages are structural and may keep `evidence: []`; framework data pages still
   need an explicit unavailable-data placeholder. Then omit or mark nonessential gaps instead of repeating the same
   queries. If bounded research or its validator is unavailable or incomplete,
   continue with supported findings, omit optional claims, and use explicit
   placeholders for required facts; never delay `index.html`. Pass resulting
   factual statements to the scaffold with repeated `--research-fact`; reserve
   `--fact` for verbatim user/source text. Treat `AuthLevel` as a ranking hint,
   not proof that a result is authoritative. When a first-party domain is known,
   prefer a `site:`-constrained query; discard SEO-looking, mirror, or unrelated
   results. Prefer at least one `claim | source | URL` evidence item on a
   public-research page when a verified source is available. Missing evidence,
   URL, or numeric traceability excludes that claim from the factual handoff,
   but never blocks outline or HTML delivery. Never label a source FIFA/IOC/official unless that returned
   URL belongs to the named institution, and never treat an unverified URL as
   verified evidence. If a `site:` query returns no matching host, never invent
   the expected URL; successfully read a known exact first-party URL, omit the
   optional claim, or use `暂无可验证公开数据` when the field itself is required.
   A normal factual-deck request already permits research
   from public authoritative sources; do not pause later to ask for permission
   to use those sources. Respect a strict/private source boundary, use an
   explicit placeholder when the allowed sources do not contain a required
   fact, and disclose material source conflicts with neutral wording.
   If `research-synthesis` is unavailable in this session, use available
   search/browser tools for at most two targeted official-source attempts per
   unresolved slide-relevant claim and never repeat an equivalent failed
   search. If those tools are unavailable or insufficient, omit optional claims
   and use explicit placeholders for required facts — never pause the deck or
   present unsourced content as fact. Keep the boundary clear: this skill turns
   researched/supplied content into a slide plan; it does not itself perform
   deep research, fact-checking, or source-credibility judgement.

Reserve `BLOCKED` for the `creative_image_mode` image-complete requirement only;
still deliver structurally valid degraded HTML. A normal deck that is merely under-specified is handled by a structural-choice
question, bounded research, omission, or an explicit placeholder — never by a
cold "I can't do this".

## Required Output

When the decision gate says an outline is needed, create an `outline.json`
beside the future `deck.json`:

In output mode, file-tool paths are already relative to the presentation
artifact root. Use `write_file(path="outline.json", ...)`; do not pass the
absolute session-workspace path and do not add another `output/` prefix. Prefer
one initial call without `chunk_index` or `final` whenever the complete JSON fits
in the current model response. Start ordered chunks only after explicit
output-length/tool-argument recovery. When the checkpoint contains
`WRITE_PENDING`, continue its exact path and `next_chunk_index`; never restart
chunk 0. If the accepted prefix is already complete JSON, send an empty next
chunk with `final=true`. A durable cross-turn checkpoint discards an incomplete
transaction; when its resumed checkpoint has no `WRITE_PENDING`, restart the
canonical outline at chunk 0 rather than guessing the old next index.

For `source_mode=user_provided`, user-stated solution requirements and proposed
architecture scope are valid planning inputs; make unsupplied implementation
details visibly advisory rather than claiming they already exist. Exact numeric facts in a page's `message` or
`bullets` are valid quantitative evidence for chart/KPI layout selection; keep
`evidence: []` when no external URL is needed. The URL-bearing evidence ledger
is mandatory only for public-research claims, not for facts supplied directly
by the user.

When that quantitative page is authored, labels, units, and values may occupy
separate editable KPI/chart fields. Preserve all page quantities and matching
labels, but do not repeat a long source sentence in every card or data cell.
For strict source-only briefs, omit optional explanatory copy when the user did
not supply it; reserve visible `待补充` for genuinely required missing fields.

```json
{
  "deck_goal": "What this deck must achieve",
  "audience": "Who will read or hear it",
  "source_mode": "user_provided | public_authoritative_research | creative_brief",
  "tone": "Visual and narrative tone",
  "design_requirements": {
    "palette": "Explicit user palette wording, for example 深蓝、米白、少量橙色点缀",
    "rule": "Preserve explicit color, geometry, direction, relationship, and count requirements verbatim; omit when none were supplied"
  },
  "storyline": "One-sentence narrative arc",
  "slides": [
    {
      "page": 1,
      "title": "Slide title",
      "message": "One core claim this slide proves",
      "bullets": [
        "3-5 concise points that support the message",
        "Each point should be a fact, argument, or data highlight",
        "Keep bullets parallel in structure and length"
      ],
      "layout": "cover | section | comparison | dashboard | timeline | matrix | chart | cards | closing",
      "visual": "Main chart/card/composition to build",
      "evidence": ["Public-research claim | source name | https://actual-source.example/page; use [] for non-evidence slides"],
      "notes": "Speaker intent, caveats, or visible assumption disclosure"
    }
  ]
}
```

Keep this as a planning artifact. Do not put CSS, HTML, or PowerPoint object
details into `outline.json`.

`design_requirements` is optional, but when the user explicitly names colors,
palette roles, a visual geometry such as a pyramid, flow direction, or an exact
item count, preserve that wording here and on the affected slide. The scaffold
turns those requirements into a persisted `design_contract`; explicit entries
are hard constraints and may not be weakened by theme or layout inference.

`audience` and `storyline` may each be either one non-empty string or a
non-empty array of strings. The validator and scaffold normalize the array form
to newline-separated text so a natural multi-audience or multi-beat outline
does not get trapped in a repair loop.

## Generation Steps

For a broad project review, sales proposal, or operating analysis request with
no supplied page order, query the registered soft recipes before drafting:

```bash
${BOX_AGENT_NODE:-node} scripts/query_outline_recipes.js --text "项目复盘"
```

The matched beats are a completeness checklist, not a fixed deck. Omit beats
without source support, merge closely related beats, split dense beats, and
preserve any explicit user order or page count. The registry lives in
`references/outline-recipes.json`; do not copy its full contents into this file.

1. Restate the user request as a deck goal, audience, and decision/action the
   deck should drive. Stay within facts supplied by the user or clearly marked
   assumptions that the user explicitly authorized.
2. Pick a storyline arc before listing slides only when the user did not already
   provide a clear order. Examples:
   - BP: problem -> solution -> product -> market -> traction -> business model
     -> competition -> team -> financing ask.
   - Strategy report: context -> diagnosis -> options -> recommendation ->
     roadmap -> risks -> next steps.
   - Analysis deck: question -> data -> findings -> implications ->
     recommendations.
3. Draft one slide per narrative beat, or map directly from the user's supplied
   page list. Each slide must have exactly one core `message`.
4. When available, bind evidence to analytical, chart, market, traction, or
   financial slides. If the user authorized assumed or illustrative evidence,
   say so in `evidence` or `notes` and plan a visible `假设`/`示意` disclosure on
   that slide; do not imply fabricated data is sourced. Assumptions may fill
   disclosed illustrative metrics or scenarios, but never private identity
   facts such as a company/project name, financing round or stage, founding
   date, team member/history/size, client, award, or ranking. For a required
   missing private fact, use `待补充` or `待客户确认` and continue; otherwise omit
   it.
5. Choose the intended `layout` and `visual` for each slide before selecting
   controlled layout ids and filling `deck.json`.
   These are executable semantic requirements, not disposable prompting hints:
   the scaffold copies them into `slide.outline_intent`, may normalize an
   incompatible requested layout, and final QA checks both compatibility and
   explicit counts such as “三段式”, “四条标签”, “四个里程碑”, or “四象限”.
   Write the intended geometry precisely enough that this check is meaningful.
   When a slide contains quantities, rankings, trends, proportions, KPIs,
   market sizing, financials, benchmarks, or operational metrics, the `visual`
   must name a concrete data display such as `KPI strip`, `bar
   chart`, `line chart`, `matrix`, `comparison table`, `heatmap`, or
   `mini-dashboard` whenever the page contains at least two real quantitative
   values; with only one value this remains strongly preferred. Do not use just
   `cards` or `text layout`. For scenario,
   use-case, capability, or demo pages, a plain `cards` layout is acceptable only
   when the cards are content-rich. If each card has just a title and 1-2 short
   lines, the `visual` must name a second layer such as a demo flow, customer
   journey, role swimlane, before/after comparison, KPI strip, icon/owner row,
   maturity ladder, cause tree, or capability matrix. Use the dedicated
   controlled layout when that relationship is the page's primary semantic.
   When a page should be image-led, name the composition rather than only saying
   “配图”: use `wide image feature` / `横向大图叙事` for
   `image-feature-v1`, or `full-bleed image` / `整页生图` for
   `image-full-bleed-v1`. Reserve the full-bleed form for one short message whose
   fixed text-safe region can coexist with a right-side visual focus.
6. Run `scripts/validate_outline.js outline.json` and fix failures before
   scaffolding `deck.json`.

## Quality Bar

- Every slide has one job. If a slide has two unrelated claims, split it.
- Titles should be short and presentation-ready.
- `message` should be a claim, not a topic label. Prefer "AI cuts manual QC
  scheduling from hours to minutes" over "Product overview".
- `bullets` should have at least 2 items; each supports `message` and maps to
  distinct content on the slide. When a qualitative collection declares an
  item count, provide exactly one bullet per item and keep counts in the title,
  message, and visual consistent. The scaffold splits overflow into linked
  slides; do not trim or merge items to fit a template. Avoid restating the title.
- Avoid repetitive slides with the same title, message, layout, or visual.
- Do not reuse the same evidence as the main support for more than two pages;
  combine repetitive pages or research another distinct fact.
- For public-research decks, omit nonessential gaps instead of planning visible
  placeholders. Use `暂无可验证公开数据` only for a required unavailable public
  fact; use `待补充` or `待客户确认` for required user/private inputs.
- Avoid sparse content slides that leave the lower half of the canvas empty.
  Divider, cover, quote, and cinematic pause slides may use intentional
  whitespace; normal business/product/demo/training slides should turn spare
  space into a chart, flow, matrix, process schematic, role lane, or other
  message-bearing visual.
- Use a section-divider slide only when it helps pacing.
- Put explicitly authorized assumptions in `evidence` or `notes` and disclose
  them visibly on the affected slide; do not hide missing data.
- For data-heavy slides with at least two real values, require a chart/table/KPI/
  dashboard visual instead of a plain bullet list. With only one value, prefer
  the same visual treatment unless the data is too sparse or text-only output
  was requested.
- Keep page numbers consecutive and aligned with the final slide count.

## Validation

Run:

```bash
${BOX_AGENT_NODE:-node} scripts/validate_outline.js outline.json --report qa/outline_check.json
```

The validator treats structure, required fields, page numbering, and the basic
storyline contract as the hard gate. Missing evidence on data-heavy slides,
page-level numeric traceability, public-research source URLs, and similar source
findings are advisory warnings: they never prevent scaffolding or `index.html`.
It is not a substitute for human/model narrative judgment.

After validation passes, pass it directly to the scaffold with
`--outline outline.json`. The scaffold writes `source_outline_page` onto every
slide. When a typed visual collection exceeds one layout's readable capacity,
the scaffold emits multiple deck slides for the same outline page and records a
contiguous `source_outline_item_range` on each split slide; the ranges must cover
the original collection exactly once. For `public_authoritative_research`, it
imports each non-empty
`slides[].evidence` string into `truth_contract.research_facts`. The slide title,
core message, visual intent, and evidence notes must stay on the same numbered
page through the content patch. Compile the validated deck to `index.html`; do
not hand-author the controlled HTML.
