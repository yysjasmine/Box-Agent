"""Regression tests for the ``finish_reason="length"`` retry ladder in
``run_agent_loop`` (introduced by PR #11 — "让 OpenAI 协议的输出截断先自愈再报错").

Before this test suite the loop unconditionally treated a ``length`` finish
as a SAME-messages retry — but streaming ``ContentEvent`` deltas had already
been forwarded to the host, so if any visible text was produced before the
cutoff the second attempt would stream its own (usually longer) reply on top
of the first partial. On CLI stdout the user saw ``partial partial partial …
partial complete`` glued together; on ACP hosts the ``update_agent_message``
deltas concatenated into the same growing message.

The loop splits ``length``/`max_tokens`` handling by whether a tool call was
attempted:

* Any tool-call attempt, parseable or broken: discard it without execution and
  inject a hidden user recovery instruction. A write_file attempt is told to
  use ordered chunks.
* Visible text present: hand off to the ``truncation_continuation`` machinery
  — the partial is appended as an assistant turn and the next LLM call is
  asked to CONTINUE from the tail rather than restart.

These tests pin those two paths and, most importantly, guarantee that a
``length`` finish with visible text does NOT re-emit that same text through
``ContentEvent``.
